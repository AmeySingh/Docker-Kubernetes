Docker Network

CNM(Container Network Model) -->libnetwork

libnetwork will provide
1. Service Discovery
2. Load Balancing

CNM -->
1. Sandboxes --> islolated network stack - Ethernet interfaces ,port, routing table, and DNS config
2. Endpoints --> virtual network interfaces - making connections, will connect to sandboxes and networks
3. Networks --> implentation of switch/ virtual switch

how are you going to provide networking to a container

Docker Host --> multiple container(C1,C2 etc) --> every container will have sandbox --> EP --> over network
