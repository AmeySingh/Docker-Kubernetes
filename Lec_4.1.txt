Docker Swarm
cluster  - collection of servers those are performing similar tasks
scaling --> adding/removing all resources on demand as per requirement
1. Horizontal/scale-out --> by adding more nodes
2. Vertical Scaling --> adding extra resources in existing node

Its a manager, orchestrator

1. enterprise grade secured cluster of Docker hosts
2. engine for orchestrating microservices apps

either use Swarm or Kubernetes

1. what is primer?
2. build our cluster
3. deploye our services

cluser --> collection of nodes

nodes --> real physical machines, VM's ,Raspberry Pi, cloud instances

nodes should have docker installed and networked together

node configure - either manager or worker
workers will accept their task from managers
TLS(Transport Layer Security) --> can we build our swarm without TLS?
No, its integral part and required.
it will ecrypty.

service --> atomic unit of schedule is called as service -- modified container


Steps for swarm
docker  swarm init --> it creates master node and initialises it

$ docker swarm init
Swarm initialized: current node (i61273zo0jfygab9he8z92srx) is now a manager.

To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

    docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-50nzp3jzjechkxe6fytvnd1kap3bjcekjbvyg0g6wx4vy9hfqm-0b9o0teu44odza1a5p33zsds2 192.168.65.3:2377

To add a manager to this swarm, run 'docker swarm join-token manager' and follow the instructions.

add worker node
docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-50nzp3jzjechkxe6fytvnd1kap3bjcekjbvyg0g6wx4vy9hfqm-0b9o0teu44odza1a5p33zsds2 192.168.65.3:2377
