Containers

runtime instance of image

can have more than one container from same image

container vs VM
containers are lightweight, faster

docker container run -it mcr.microsoft.com/powershell

run and exec command
1. run container
docker container run -it ubuntu

2. docker container ls
if it is listed you can use exec

3. docker exec with conatiner id

docker container exec -it 9c0ac4357d52 bash

stopping container might still take some time so its still avialble when we do docker ps -a but docker container rm removes it entirly

Container Lifcycle
1. image --> run --> created --> run --> pause --> stop --> delete/rm
